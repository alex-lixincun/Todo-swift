# TODO List - Swift Version
Description

-	No matter what your responsibilities are at work, chances are you can’t keep it all in your head. Our brains just aren’t very good at remembering everything we’re supposed to do. For a long time, we wrote down daily TODO’s on paper — and plenty of people still do. But mobile apps let you take your personal productivity much, much further. And there’s a good chance you’ll be more productive.
-	TODO List will be a thoughtfully designed, powerful, and intuitive app for managing your tasks. One of the most important parts of staying organized is being able to capture a thought at any moment. The mobile apps do a good job letting you add tasks quickly.
-	For a safety reason, TODO List will be keep the tasks into your Cloud account, which means you can backup and restore full list into your Cloud.
